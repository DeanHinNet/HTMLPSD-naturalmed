                    <h3>About Vulvodynia</h3>
                    <p><span class='v'>Vulvodynia</span> is a condition, which few in the medical profession have yet to resolve or even understand. Little research exists and little is known about its origins or how best to treat it. What does seem apparent is that for those women who that do have it, it is constant daily dis-ease. Characteristics of Vulvodynia may vary from woman to the next, what is very certain is that there is usually pain and possible burning of the vulva. The level of pain can change from mild to severe. The etiology behind the condition may vary from one woman to the next, so differential diagnosis is essential for individual patient care. This differential diagnosis is what sets Chinese Medicine aside from Western Medical approach. Two women with the same diagnosis may have completely different disharmonies, so treatment is very unique to the patient's personal body care.</p>
